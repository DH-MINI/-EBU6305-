                            China, Nezha is China's first wide-screen animated feature film and once again radiates the
                            glory of the national style with its majestic representation. Based on parts of the classic
                            novel Romance of the Gods, Nezha tells the story of a feud between Nezha, the son of Li Jing
                            in Chentang Pass, and the Dragon Palace in the East China Sea. With rich imagination, the
                            film revolves around the four important links of Nezha's "birth, death, regeneration and
                            disturbance", which progress layer by layer and are gripping. The film has a beautiful
                            picture and a touching plot, and has received a lot of praise when it was released at home
                            and abroad.
