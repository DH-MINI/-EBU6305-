                                    <p>In the story of Journey to the West, there is no direct description of a fight
                                        between the Monkey King's doppelganger and Ne Zha. However, we can speculate
                                        what their battle might be like based on their abilities and personalities.</p>
                                    <p>The Monkey King's doppelganger is a transformation of the Six-Eared Macaque,
                                        possessing almost the same magical powers, divine abilities, and weapons as the
                                        Monkey King. </p>
                                    <p>Ne Zha is the third son of the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King, possessing
                                        supernatural strength, three heads, six arms, and magical treasures such as the
                                        Wind Fire Wheels and the Universe Ring. Ne Zha has a fiery personality, hates
                                        evil, and dares to challenge authority.</p>
                                    <p>When the Monkey King's doppelganger and Ne Zha meet, both will believe the other
                                        to be the real Monkey King. Due to their similar abilities, the battle will be
                                        fierce and evenly matched. The Monkey King's doppelganger will use his cunning
                                        and imitation abilities to try to confuse Ne Zha. Ne Zha will rely on his divine
                                        power and magical treasures to confront the Monkey King's doppelganger head-on.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The battle may ultimately end with the appearance of the Monkey King, who will
                                        expose the Six-Eared Macaque's true identity and defeat him. The Monkey King's
                                        doppelganger will eventually be defeated by the Monkey King, and Ne Zha will
                                        also stop fighting due to the Monkey King's appearance. This battle will be a
                                        showdown between equally matched opponents, showcasing the strengths and
                                        characteristics of both sides.</p>
                                    <p>The battle between the Monkey King's doppelganger and Ne Zha will be a thrilling
                                        spectacle, showcasing the abilities and personalities of both characters.
                                        Ultimately, the Monkey King will expose the Six-Eared Macaque's true identity
                                        and defeat him.</p>
